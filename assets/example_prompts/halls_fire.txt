Halls Fire Department, founded in 1950, is a 501c volunteer agency located in Clinton, NC, with an annual operating budget of approximately $185,000. We respond to 500 calls per year across a 42-square-mile rural district, serving roughly 3,800 residents with a roster of 28 active members. Our primary need is grant funding to replace expiring SCBA equipment.
We currently possess 18 Scott Safety Air-Pak 75 units that were purchased in 2011. The cylinders are reaching the end of their 15-year service life in early 2026 and will no longer be hydrostatically compliant. Additionally, we are experiencing frequent failures with the integrated PASS alarms and the face piece regulators are becoming difficult to source parts for. To maintain operational readiness and NFPA 1981 compliance, we need to replace the entire fleet: 18 packs, 36 cylinders, and 28 face pieces.
We operate as a Medical First Responder agency supporting Sampson County EMS. Approximately 320 of our 500 annual calls are EMS or Rescue related. Because our district is rural, we are often on the scene 10 to 15 minutes before the ambulance arrives, meaning our volunteers are managing patient care for extended periods.
The mission of Halls Fire Department is to preserve life, property, and the environment in the Halls district and surrounding Sampson County through rapid, professional emergency response. As an all-volunteer force, our purpose is to act as the primary safety net for our 3,800 neighbors, providing fire suppression, vehicle rescue, and medical first response services. We are dedicated to serving our community with integrity and compassion, ensuring that help is always available regardless of our limited funding.
