Pemigewasset Valley Search and Rescue Team, founded in 2005, is a 501(c)(3) all-volunteer non-profit organization based in Franconia, NH. We operate with an annual budget dependent entirely on donations and grants, receiving no direct funding from state or federal tax revenues. We respond to approximately 30-40 missions annually across Grafton County and the western White Mountains, serving the thousands of hikers and outdoor enthusiasts who visit the rugged Pemigewasset Wilderness each year. Our roster consists of over 85 active volunteers who are on call 24/7. Our primary need is grant funding to upgrade our technical rescue and patient transport equipment.

We currently rely on aging titanium litters and static ropes that have seen extensive use in high-angle and rough-terrain extractions. The physical demands of our service area—where a single carry-out can take 12 hours and require 30 rescuers—means our gear degrades faster than typical agencies. To maintain safety standards and operational efficiency during complex winter and night operations, we need to acquire a new break-apart rescue litter with a heavy-duty trail wheel system, 600 feet of static rescue rope, and updated handheld GPS units for our field team leaders.

We operate as a primary support resource for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The vast majority of our calls involve locating lost hikers or stabilizing and extracting injured subjects from remote terrain far from paved roads. Unlike urban agencies, our "scene times" are measured in hours or days, not minutes, requiring our members to be self-sufficient in extreme weather while providing prolonged patient care in the backcountry.

The mission of the Pemigewasset Valley Search and Rescue Team is to provide skilled, efficient, and compassionate search and rescue services to those lost or injured in the woodlands of New Hampshire. As a volunteer force, we are dedicated to assisting state authorities and our community by bringing loved ones home safely, regardless of the terrain, weather, or time of day.
