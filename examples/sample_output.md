EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maple Grove Volunteer Fire Department, an all-volunteer organization serving
4,500 rural Pennsylvania residents since 1952, requests funding to replace
critical Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment that has reached
the end of its certified service life. Our current SCBA units, averaging over
10 years old, no longer meet current NFPA standards and pose significant
safety risks to our 32 volunteer firefighters. This grant will fund six new
SCBA units valued at approximately $48,000, ensuring our firefighters can
safely enter hazardous environments during the 52 structure fires and 195
total emergency calls we respond to annually. This investment directly
protects both our firefighters and the 4,500 community members we serve.

ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Established in 1952, Maple Grove Volunteer Fire Department has served the
residents of Maple Grove and surrounding areas of Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania for over 70 years. Our all-volunteer organization protects a
service area of 22 square miles with a population of approximately 4,500
residents in this rural community.

The department operates with 32 dedicated volunteer firefighters and maintains
an annual operating budget of $185,000. We are a registered 501(c)(3)
nonprofit organization (Tax ID: 23-1234567). Our apparatus fleet includes two
fire engines, one ambulance, and two utility vehicles. While our volunteers
are highly trained and committed, our equipment inventory shows significant
age-related concerns, with our primary engine being 18 years old and most SCBA
equipment exceeding 10 years of service life.

In 2022, we achieved an ISO Class 5 rating, reflecting our commitment to
professional standards despite being an all-volunteer organization. We
maintain mutual aid agreements with six surrounding departments and actively
participate in regional emergency response coordination. Our recent
accomplishments include achieving 100% CPR/First Aid certification for all
active members and implementing a successful junior firefighter program to
ensure sustainable volunteer recruitment.

Our department is deeply integrated into the Maple Grove community, providing
not only emergency response but also fire prevention education, community
safety programs, and public service. We are trusted partners in community
safety and take our responsibility seriously.

STATEMENT OF NEED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maple Grove VFD faces a critical equipment deficiency that directly threatens
firefighter safety and our ability to protect the community we serve. Our
current SCBA equipment, with an average age exceeding 10 years, is approaching
or has exceeded NFPA-mandated service life limits. According to NFPA 1981
standards, SCBA units must be removed from service after 15 years or when they
fail to meet performance specifications.

The data clearly demonstrates the urgent need:
- Annual Fire Calls: 52 structure and wildland fires
- Annual EMS Calls: 143 medical emergencies
- Mutual Aid Responses: 38 requests from neighboring departments
- Total Annual Responses: 195 emergency calls
- Average Response Time: 6.5 minutes

During structure fire responses, our firefighters must enter immediately
dangerous to life and health (IDLH) atmospheres. Outdated SCBA equipment
significantly increases the risk of equipment failure at the most critical
moments. Recent incidents have included breathing apparatus malfunctions that
forced firefighters to evacuate structures prematurely, compromising
firefighting effectiveness and potentially allowing fires to spread.

The gap between our current state and necessary capabilities is stark. We
need six new SCBA units to replace our oldest equipment and ensure adequate
apparatus for all emergency responses. Without this equipment, we risk:
- Firefighter injury or death from equipment failure
- Delayed or ineffective fire attack due to inadequate SCBA availability
- Inability to respond to mutual aid requests
- Potential OSHA violations for knowingly using expired equipment

Furthermore, 40% of our active members use turnout gear that exceeds NFPA
retirement guidelines, compounding the safety concerns. This creates an
untenable situation where volunteers who sacrifice their time to protect the
community are themselves placed at unnecessary risk due to equipment
inadequacies beyond the department's financial capacity to address.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project will acquire six (6) new Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus
(SCBA) units meeting current NFPA 1981 standards to replace our aging,
non-compliant equipment and ensure adequate respiratory protection for our
firefighters.

Technical Specifications:
The SCBA units will be NIOSH-approved, 30-minute or 45-minute rated systems
with the following features:
- Positive pressure operation
- Heads-up display (HUD) showing air supply status
- PASS (Personal Alert Safety System) device
- Quick-disconnect coupling
- Compatible face pieces with communication capability
- Integrated thermal imaging camera mounting capability

Implementation Timeline:
Month 1-2: Grant award, vendor selection, and equipment specification
Month 3: Equipment order and delivery
Month 4: Training on new equipment for all active members
Month 5-6: Full deployment and integration into operational protocols

Deployment Plan:
The new SCBA units will be distributed across our apparatus to ensure maximum
availability:
