As an all-volunteer organization, we are committed to excellence in emergency services while maintaining fiscal responsibility and serving our neighbors with dedication.",
  "community_impact": "Our department serves a rural community of 4,500 residents spread across 22 square miles. We respond to an average of 195 emergency calls per year, including structure fires, vehicle accidents, medical emergencies, and mutual aid requests to neighboring departments. Without adequate equipment and training, our response capabilities are compromised, potentially increasing response times and putting both firefighters and community members at risk. Recent incidents have highlighted critical equipment gaps, particularly outdated SCBA equipment and insufficient protective gear.",
