# Civic Grant Agent - YouTube Demo Video Script
## Target Length: 3 minutes
## Track: Google ADK "Agents for Good"

---

## SCENE 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:30)
**30 seconds**

### Visuals
- B-roll of volunteer fire station
- Firefighters at scene
- Aging equipment
- Stack of grant applications

### Script
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name], a software engineer and volunteer firefighter. 
> 
> My department, like thousands of volunteer fire departments across America, struggles with a critical challenge: securing funding.
>
> We rely on grants to buy life-saving equipment—SCBA masks, turnout gear, AEDs—but finding and applying for grants is overwhelming.
>
> Grant research takes 20+ hours per week. Writing applications? Another 15-20 hours each. Small volunteer departments simply don't have that time."

### Key Message
Establish the real-world problem and your credibility.

---

## SCENE 2: THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:00)
**30 seconds**

### Visuals
- Show code editor with project
- Architecture diagram
- Google ADK logo
- Gemini AI branding

### Script
> "That's why I built Civic Grant Agent using Google's Agent Developer Kit.
>
> It's a multi-agent system—a team of AI agents working together—that autonomously finds grants, validates eligibility, and drafts professional applications.
>
> Three specialized agents:
> - GrantScout searches the web for opportunities
> - GrantValidator checks if we're eligible using custom tools
> - GrantWriter creates complete draft applications using Gemini
>
> What used to take 20 hours now takes 20 minutes."

### Key Message
Introduce the solution and its AI-powered capabilities.

---

## SCENE 3: THE BUILD (1:00 - 2:00)
**60 seconds**

### Visuals
- Screen recording of architecture diagram
- Code walkthrough (main.py)
- Terminal showing agent execution
- Generated draft output

### Script
> "Here's how it works. [Show diagram]
>
> The architecture uses three key ADK concepts:
>
> **First: Built-in Tools.** GrantScout uses Google Search to discover grants automatically. [Show search results]
>
> **Second: Custom Tools.** GrantValidator uses a custom eligibility checker I built—it analyzes grant requirements against our department profile. [Show eligibility check code]
>
> **Third: Sessions and Memory.** The department profile—our needs, budget, location—is stored in session memory and shared across all agents. [Show session manager]
>
> Let me show it in action. [Screen recording]
>
> I run the program... GrantScout finds potential grants... GrantValidator checks eligibility—here it found 3 matches... and GrantWriter is drafting applications powered by Gemini.
>
> [Show output file]
>
> Here's a complete, professional grant application. Executive summary, needs statement, budget narrative—everything a grant requires. Generated in minutes."

### Key Message
Demonstrate the technical implementation and ADK features.

### Screen Recording Checklist
- [ ] Show `python main.py` command
- [ ] Show agent logs in terminal
- [ ] Open generated draft file
- [ ] Scroll through draft sections
- [ ] Show summary.json with statistics

## SCENE 4: THE VALUE (2:00 - 2:30)
**30 seconds**

### Visuals
- Side-by-side comparison (before/after)
- Grant funding stats
- Community impact photos
- Fire department serving community

### Script
> "The impact is real.
>
> This system saves volunteer departments 20+ hours per week in grant research and turns a 15-hour writing task into a 1-hour review.
>
> That means more grant applications, more funding secured, and ultimately, better equipment to protect our communities.
>
> This is AI being used for real good—helping the volunteers who protect us get the resources they need."

### Key Message
Emphasize real-world impact and "Agents for Good" theme.

---

## SCENE 5: CLOSING (2:30 - 3:00)
**30 seconds**

### Visuals
- GitHub repository
- Project stats
- Call to action screen
- Personal photo at fire station

### Script
> "This project demonstrates what's possible with Google's Agent Developer Kit:
> - Multi-agent coordination
> - Custom and built-in tools
> - Session memory management  
> - And the power of Gemini for generating high-quality content
>
> The code is open source on GitHub. If you're part of a volunteer fire department or know someone who is, this could help your community too.
>
> This is how agents can make a real-world impact. Thank you."
